The desing of this prototype is inspired (actually a mockup of) [Timely Alarm Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely)

Preview using [Mirror.js](http://jimulabs.com/mirrorjs-preview/) and select `fragment_add_alarm`, the screen for configuring alarm time by dragging the bar.
The item "10:30" is linked to `fragment_add_alarm`
