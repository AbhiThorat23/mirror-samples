The design of this prototype is inspired by (actually a mockup of) [Timely Alarm Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely)

Preview using [Mirror.js](http://jimulabs.com/mirrorjs-preview/) and select `fragment_add_alarm`, the screen for configuring alarm time by dragging the bar.

Review the following files for how things are implemented:

- mirror/activty_main.xml
- mirror/fragment_add_alarm.xml
- mirror/js/add_alarm.js
