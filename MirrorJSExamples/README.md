This project consists of a few simple examples of how to use Mirror.js

- Preview the project using jimu Mirror ([Mirror.js preview](http://jimulabs.com/mirrorjs-preview)) plugin for Android Studio
- Open "fancy_animatio_choreography" and "screen_transition_grid" first (to get a first impression)
- Move on to other simpler examples such as "property_animation", "animation_choreography" etc. 
- Make sure to check out the "mirror/js" directory that's where all the new stuff is.

Let us know what you think!
